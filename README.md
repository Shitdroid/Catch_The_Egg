# Catch_The_Egg
My first project in Level-1 Term-1 of my CS Undergraduate Course.

Just unzip the zip file. It is in .7z format. You can use 7zip to extract it. If you don't have that you can download it from here "https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" 

After extracting go to the folder. There should be a folder and a shortcut. Double click the shortcut "Catch The Egg" and the game should start. The source file "Catching eggs.cpp" is inside the folder "1905026".

The igraphics library was used to create the project. As the library uses C++ components it is in cpp format but the language used is primarily C. Its not much but its honest work and I am proud of it.

Hope you enjoy it. If you come across any problem or if want to suggest something feel free to create an issue thread.
