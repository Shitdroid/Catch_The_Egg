# Catch_The_Egg
My first project in Level-1 Term-1 of my CS Undergraduate Course.

The igraphics library was used to create the project. As the library uses C++ components it is in cpp format but the language used is primarily C. Its not much but its honest work and I am proud of it.

To play it go to the [releases](https://github.com/Shitdroid/Catch_The_Egg/releases/tag/pub) section and download the zip file. 

Hope you enjoy it. If you come across any problem or if want to suggest something feel free to create an issue thread.
